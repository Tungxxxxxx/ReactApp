                We get a lot of issues every day, and some of them may lack
                necessary information. You can help out by guiding people
                through the process of filling out the issue template, asking
                for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues
                that match their description of the problem. We cover more about

            The process of proposing a change to React Native can be summarized
            as follows:

          <ol>
            <li>
              Fork the React Native repository and create your branch from{" "}
              <code>main</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make the desired changes to React Native sources. Use the{" "}
              <code>packages/rn-tester</code> app to test them out.
            </li>
            <li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.</li>
            <li>
              If you've changed APIs, update the documentation, which lives in{" "}

            <li>
              Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you
              opened a pull request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure your code lints (for example via{" "}
              <code>yarn lint --fix</code>).
            </li>
            <li>Push the changes to your fork.</li>
